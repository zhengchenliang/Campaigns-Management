Let me initiate a new ticket anyway in case this campaign was never mentioned here (likely not since I didn't find a pilot...): we'd like to ask for a pLHEGS campaign for winter25:

Run3Winter25pLHEGS

We are preparing a new pilot now, should be coming in few hours

Please consider opening it, thanks!

PRCAMPAIGNS-447: New PrePremix Campaign for 2024 Production 
Status: To Do

Description: Dear PnR,

 

We (PPD/PdmV) are planning the opening of a new campaign:

[RunIIISummer24PrePremix|https://cms-pdmv-prod.web.cern.ch/mcm/campaigns?prepid=RunIIISummer24PrePremix&page=0&shown=63m]

for the upcoming Summer24 productions (namely 2024+2022ReRECO+2023ReRECO productions)

We have most of the ingredients, with only few terms left, therefore we'd like to test if things work well with the current things.

Can you please add this campaign into production, with the current 2024 MinBias as the pileup input?

Saying: [/MinBias_TuneCP5_13p6TeV-pythia8/RunIII2024Summer24GS-140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v20-v1/GEN-SIM|https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?input=/MinBias_TuneCP5_13p6TeV-pythia8/RunIII2024Summer24GS-140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v20-v1/GEN-SIM]

Status: Open
Priority: Major
Updated: 2019-08-19T17:44:43.000+0200
Description: Dear Computing, 

There were some flows submitted in past which had the chain RunIISummer16MiniAODv3 + RunIISummer16NanoAODv3 but since we closed the nAODv3 processing if there is any possibility that we can reopen the RunIISummer16NanoAODv3 campaign and once all of the requests are done we can submit nAODv5. Otherwise we have to do it manually and it is going to be a lot of work. What do you think? Does it sounds good to you? From your end it is going to be re opening of campaign but from our end it is going to be huge amount of manual work.
